# RAG-Q-A-Conversation-With-PDF-Including-Chat-History
Conversational AI for extracting insights from PDFs with context-aware chat history!

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Question-Answering (Q&A) system that allows users to interact with PDF documents in a conversational manner. The system not only extracts relevant information from PDFs but also maintains chat history for context-aware conversations. Built using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, this tool is perfect for anyone looking to extract insights from large documents or build intelligent document-based chatbots.

# Features ‚ú®

PDF Interaction: Upload and query PDF documents using natural language.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines retrieval-based and generative models for accurate and context-aware answers.

Chat History: Maintains conversation history for context-aware follow-up questions.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive experience.

Customizable: Easily adapt the system to your own documents or use cases.

# How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

Document Upload: Users upload a PDF document.

Query Processing: The system processes natural language queries and retrieves relevant information from the PDF.

Context-Aware Responses: Using RAG and chat history, the system generates accurate and context-aware answers.

Interactive Chat: Users can ask follow-up questions, and the system maintains the conversation flow.
